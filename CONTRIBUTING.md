## How to contribute to this repository

This product is built one step at a time by an automated maintainer that turns the product vision into a working product through your contributions. Read this before opening a pull request.

### Currently accepted
Current accepted work: **#78 Add one real audio clarity choice that affects preview and export**. A PR must complete that issue's Acceptance through the normal product workflow.

Only implementation PRs that complete the current active step are accepted. Docs-only, planning-only, off-step, speculative, demo-only, mock-only, and unrelated PRs are closed even when the work is technically good.

### Work the one active step
At any moment there is exactly **one** open issue labeled `bl:active-step`. That issue is the only work being accepted right now. It describes what to build and a clear **Acceptance** (definition of done). Find it in this repo's Issues filtered by the `bl:active-step` label.

The maintainer acts like a hands-on product lead: it keeps the current goal focused, verifies behavior in the running product, and may replace a step with a prerequisite if repeated PRs show the target was missing a foundation.

### Open a pull request that completes that step
- Your PR must fully satisfy the active step's Acceptance, and reference it (for example, "Closes #<number>").
- Keep it focused: do that step and nothing unrelated.
- **One PR per contributor per step.** You may have only one open pull request for the active step, so put your best work into it. If you open a second PR for the same step, it is closed automatically. To revise your submission, push to your existing PR's branch (it is re-reviewed automatically) instead of opening another.

### Your PR is run, not just read
Every PR is checked out and executed in a sandbox: it must build, the existing tests must still pass, and the repo's acceptance checks (see `.builderloops/verify.json` if present) must pass. A PR that does not build, breaks tests, or fails acceptance is closed automatically. Make sure it genuinely works.

### What gets merged, what gets closed
- The best PR that completes the active step and passes review and execution is merged. When it merges, the step closes and the maintainer opens the next step.
- PRs that do something other than the active step are closed, even if the work is good. Wait until that work becomes the active step.
- A PR is merged only when it clearly completes the step and its benefit outweighs the added complexity; otherwise it is closed with a specific reason.

### Labels
This repo does not require Gittensor scoring labels on merged PRs. The maintainer may use operational labels such as active-step labels only for workflow control.

# Contributing

This repo is curated by its maintainers for **Podcast Design Canvas**. A technically working change is not enough: it must move this product toward the captured vision and fit the taste rules for this repo.

## What To Build
- Create a new episode by importing a Riverside link or uploading separate synced video files for each speaker
- then assign each file to clear speaker buckets such as Host
- Guest 1
- and Guest 2.
- Add host and guest social links during setup so the product can understand names
- topics
- references
- brands
- and likely transcript spellings before generating the edit.
- Choose a preset visual style with layout and pacing options
- preview how the episode will look
- and apply it without needing to manually position every element.
- Open a canvas editor to build or customize a reusable podcast layout by dragging and layering speaker video frames
- shapes
- backgrounds
- captions
- title elements
- b-roll areas
- and overlays.
- Clean and balance episode audio with simple controls for noise reduction
- leveling
- enhancement
- and speech clarity
- presented as creator-facing quality choices rather than technical audio settings.
- Use contextual editing tools to add captions
- b-roll overlays
- visual callouts
- title moments
- and short-form-style engagement patterns at key moments across a full-length episode.
- Save a finished layout or style as a reusable show template so future episodes can keep the same identity while still adapting to each episode's speakers and topics.
- Export a polished long-form video episode that feels deliberately edited
- visually coherent
- accurately captioned
- and ready to publish.

## What To Avoid
- Do not make the normal user think about internal production mechanics or technical pipeline details.
- Do not force a single visual house style across all podcasts.
- Do not bury simple users in a blank-canvas editor before offering strong preset choices.
- Do not make social research feel invasive: use it to improve accuracy and relevance
- not to surface unrelated personal details.
- Do not overproduce every moment with constant effects
- b-roll
- or captions that distract from the conversation.
- Do not create outputs that only work for short clips
- the core product must handle hour-plus podcast episodes.
- Do not preserve old PR queues, labels, branches, maintainer state, or repo state.
- Do not reward docs, spec, routing, issue, or planning-only work once the repo is bootstrapped.
- Do not accept isolated helpers or internal plumbing unless they directly unlock a visible end-to-end workflow.
- Do not merge code unless it is complete, testable, and clearly worth the complexity it adds.
- Do not preserve old PR queues, labels, branches, maintainer state, or repo state.
- Do not reward docs, spec, routing, issue, or planning-only work once the repo is bootstrapped.
- Do not accept isolated helpers or internal plumbing unless they directly unlock a visible end-to-end workflow.
- Do not merge code unless it is complete, testable, and clearly worth the complexity it adds.

## Pull Request Standard

Submit one focused product improvement at a time. The maintainers prefer small, complete, verifiable changes over broad speculative rewrites.

## Current Contribution Focus

This repo is currently accepting implementation work only, focused on active build targets maintained as GitHub issues.

Accepted PRs should ship or directly verify product behavior through code, prototypes, tests, workflows, configuration, or implementation changes, and should clearly advance one active build target.

Docs-only, spec-only, planning-only, README/CONTRIBUTING/VISION-only, Markdown-only, typo-only, and stale-reference PRs are closed by default.

Standalone prototype fragments are closed by default once active build targets exist. New screens and prototypes must be wired into the preview shell, a named flow, or a testable product path rather than living as isolated files.

If the repo has build-target issues open, contributors should reference the relevant issue and explain how the PR moves that target closer to completion.

A PR should include:
- the user-facing improvement
- the active build target it advances, when one exists
- the workflow or taste rule it advances
- verification performed
- screenshots or preview notes when the change affects UI

## Maintainer Policy

The default policy is merge or close. There is no long requested-changes queue.

Merge requires unanimous maintainer approval. A PR is merged only when it is ready now, aligned with the Vision Model, and clearly improves the product more than the complexity, code, dependencies, abstractions, surface area, or maintenance burden it adds.

Maintainers merge work that:
- Merge clean PRs that pass CI, match the Vision Model, and improve an accepted workflow or quality bar.
- Prefer small coherent changes that can ship immediately over broad speculative rewrites.
- Treat product taste and user workflow fit as first-class acceptance criteria.
- Summarize merged work as product progress, not as raw PR activity.

Maintainers close work that:
- Close PRs that are docs-only, spec-only, planning-only, too small to matter, reward-farming, or likely to create product drift.
- Close PRs that are incomplete, off-vision, overlapping, stale, or likely to create product drift.
- Close technically correct PRs when they solve the wrong problem or move the product away from the captured vision.
- Close technically plausible PRs when the benefit is not clearly greater than the complexity or surface area added.
- Closed comments explain why the PR was closed. They are not an invitation to keep revising the same PR unless the maintainer explicitly says so.

## Scoring Labels

Do not add or request Gittensor scoring labels. This repo is registered with `default_label_multiplier: 1.0`, so accepted merged PRs score without `gittensor:*` labels.

Maintainer-only operational labels may be used to track active steps or controller state. They are not contributor scoring labels.

## Branches

Target `main` unless the maintainers explicitly publish another branch policy for this repo.

## Checks
- Keep `typecheck` passing or explain why it does not apply.
- Keep `lint` passing or explain why it does not apply.
- Keep `test` passing or explain why it does not apply.
- Keep `preview-build` passing or explain why it does not apply.
